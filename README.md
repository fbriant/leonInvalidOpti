# leonInvalidOpti

Works exactly as Leon, no need to specify some argument, it will automatically try to optimise any weird invalid results of the verification phase.

Directory "SAVProject" contains all non-code submission for the SAV project, i.e. :

- The slides I presented on the project presentation, which are outdated with my project's current version.
- The project report which is up-to-date with the project's current version.
